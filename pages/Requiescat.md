- > TREAD lightly, she is nearUnder the snow,Speak gently, she can hearThe daisies grow. //All her bright golden hairTarnished with rust,She that was young and fairFallen to dust. //Lily-like, white as snow,She hardly knewShe was a woman, soSweetly she grew. //Coffin-board, heavy stone,Lie on her breast,I vex my heart alone,She is at rest. //Peace, peace, she cannot hearLyre or sonnet,All my life’s buried here,Heap earth upon it.
