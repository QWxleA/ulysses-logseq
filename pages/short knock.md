- Early on in_Calypso_Joyce repeatedly introduces his readers to a feature of Bloom's mind that will reappear throughout the day: his preoccupation with schemes for making and saving money. In several passages from this part of the book, he thinks of ways that sharp people make a quick profit, often by transgressing moral and legal boundaries. Bloom himself appears concerned to stay on the right side of these lines, but he is keenly interested in other people's dodgier schemes, and his thoughts are full of contemporary Irish and British idioms for such actions. â€” [The Joyce Project : Ulysses : Short knock](http://m.joyceproject.com/notes/040059shortknock.html)
