- Hypostasis is the joining of divine and human, in Stephen’s context Christ’s presence in the Eucharist. Joyce is calling hypostasis the imp. In modern parlance Stephen’s suggesting that this paradox is a hard nut to crack Occam, go on , fix that if you dare !
- This paragraph is a great example of the contrasts and opposites coexistent in Proteus – down, up, Christ, human, at the same instant there are at least two services on, one priest elevates the host and at the same time another locks it in a pyx.
- "A misty English morning the imp hypostasis tickled his brain": strangely, Stephen pairs a most abstruse thought (how Occam imagined that Christ's body could be simultaneously present in different wafers) with a bit of a nursery rhyme from Mother Goose. This incongruous intrusion of a popular ditty in Proteus resembles another in Hades.
